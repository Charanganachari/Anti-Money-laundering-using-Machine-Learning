**Anti-Money-laundering using Machine Learning**

Business-Problem: 
Money laundering is the illegal process of disguising the true origin, ownership, or destination of illegally obtained funds or assets by passing them through a complex web of transactions or financial activities. The purpose of money laundering is to make the proceeds of criminal activites, such as drug trafficiking, corruption, fraud or illegal arms sales, appear legitimate or clean by integrating them into the legitimate financial system
Money laundering typically involves 3 phases: they are:-
1) Placement
2) Layering
3) Integration

Business solutions:
Based on the Business Problem we implemented anti-money laundering(AML) laws and regulations to detect and prevent money laundering activities and to promote greater transparency and accountability in the financial sector. e.g. banks, financial instutions.
